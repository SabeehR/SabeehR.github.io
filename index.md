I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 1, part 1

    I like this lab because I learned the basics of coding with a hello world program. Also I had to configure git and I also learned more about linux and its terminal which is a key essential to know for future labs. Overall, this lab helped me build a solid foundation for coding and version control, which will be really useful for more advanced projects down the line.

* Lab 4, part 2

    For this lab I like how you can make a game between two players. Where one player picks a number and the other player tries to guess that number with hints of the number being too high or too low. I learned how to create this program using if else statements.

* Lab 9, part 2

    In this lab I like how you input a secret number and the other player has to guess the number. If you lose the game it tells you the number and it tells you what the secret number is between two numbers. I learned how to use conditional statements and loops to compare guesses with the secret number and control the flow of the game.
