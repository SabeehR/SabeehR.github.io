## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, part 1
    
    I like this lab because I learned the basics of coding with a “Hello, World!” program. I also had to configure Git, and I learned more about Linux and its terminal, which are essential skills for future labs. Overall, this lab helped me build a solid foundation in coding and version control, which will be very useful for more advanced projects down the line.

* Lab 4, part 2

    For this lab, I like how you can create a game between two players, where one player picks a number and the other player tries to guess it, receiving hints whether the guess is too high or too low. I learned how to create this program using if-else statements. This exercise helped me understand how to implement basic logic in code and improve user interaction.

* Lab 9, part 2

    In this lab, I like how you input a secret number, and the other player has to guess it. If you lose the game, it reveals the secret number and tells you the range it was between. I learned how to use conditional statements and loops to compare guesses with the secret number and control the flow of the game. This helped me understand how to structure logic in a way that makes the game interactive and dynamic.
